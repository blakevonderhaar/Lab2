                    <p>Started off the day by sleeping in until 11am. Got up and got ready for my first Physics quiz. After that I went down to the beach to hang out with some friends and play Spikeball. After we played Spikeball then we went to my buddy's work, Puesto, in downtown La Jolla and then went to eat it by La Jolla Cove. After that we went to hang out at their apartment for alittle. Then we went to this place called Somi Somi to get some ice cream and finished off the night by hanging out at their apartment.</p>

            <h2>Saturday, April 10th</h2>
            <p>I woke up and made some pancakes with some buddies. After that I went back home to go surf with some other buddies. Surf was super fun and the wind was great the entire session so the conditions for mid-day was perfect. After that I went back home and started catching up on some lectures from the previous week. Then I went over to my buddy's place to hang with some people and had dinner and watched a movie. Then I went back home and watched anther movie with my family.</p>

            <h2>Sunday, April 11th</h2>
            <p>I slept in again. Then I went to surf by myself since the buddies I surf with are going on a surf trip to Nicaragua. After that I came back home and worked on homework to get all the way caught up and finish some assignments due.</p>
